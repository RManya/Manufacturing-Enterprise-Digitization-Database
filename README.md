# Manufacturing Enterprise Digitization Database

Project performed for the course INFO6210 - Data Management and Database Design.

Despite having the expertise and workforce to work on the manufacturing processes and daily functioning, small businesses are often capped on the growth due to a brightly visible yet ignored fact of digitization of the business. Digitization in this context means creating and maintaining an ERP or a management system to track the daily functioning of the small business.

In this project, our goal is to design and implement a system for a small-scale manufacturing firm. This system covers all aspects of the functioning of the enterprise and aims to conveniently give access to all employees according to their rights. With this project, we aim to organize the small scale firm in a more efficient way and ensure nothing slips through the cracks.
